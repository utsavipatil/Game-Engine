## SOLID Principle
### *S - Single Responsibility Principle*
+ Every class should have one responsibility in out program

### *O - Open Closed Principle*
+ Open for extension and closed for modification

> Following 3 are related to inheritance
### *L - Liskov Substitution Principle*
+ Subclass should implement all methods of the superclass

### *I - Interface Segregation Principle*
+ Client should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they not use
+ Same concept used in MicroServices

### *D - Dependency Inversion Principle*
+ High-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. This helps decouple the high-level and low-level ones without affecting the high-level ones.
+ The way you implement O(Open-Closed Principle) is Dependency Inversion
